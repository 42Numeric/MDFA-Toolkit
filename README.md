# MDFA-Toolkit

The multivariate direct filter approach is a generic real-time signal extraction and forecasting framework endowed with a richly parameterized user-interface
allowing for adaptive and fully-regularized data analysis in large multivariate time series. The methodology is based entirely in the frequency domain, where 
all optimization criteria is defined from regularization, to forecasting, to filter constraints. For an in-depth tutorial on the mathematical formation, 
the reader is invited to check out any of the many publications or tutorials on the subject from https://blog.zhaw.ch/sef.

This MDFA-Toolkit provides a fast, modularized, and adaptive framework 
in JAVA for doing such real-time signal extraction for a variety of applications. Furthermore, we have developed several components to the package featuring streaming
time series data analysis tools not previously available anywhere else. Such new features include:
1) A fractional differencing optimization tool for transforming nonstationary time-series into stationary time series while preserving memory (inspired by Marcos Lopez de Prado's 
recent book on Advances in Financial Machine Learning, Wiley 2018). 
2) Easy to use interface to four different signal generation outputs:
   Univariate series -> univariate signal
   Univariate series -> multivariate signal
   Multivariate series -> univariate signal
   Multivariate series -> multivariate signal
3) Generalization of optimization criterion for the signal extraction. One can use a periodogram, or a model-based spectral density of the data, or anything in between.
4) Real-time adaptive parameterization control - make slight adjustments to the filter process parameterization effortlessly
5) Build a filtering process from several simpler filters, reducing degrees of freedom

This package also provides an API to three other real-time data analysis frameworks that are now or soon available 
   iMetricaFX - An app written entirely in JavaFX for doing time series data analysis with MDFA
   MDFA-DeepLearning - A new recurrent neural network methodology for learning in large noisy time series
   MDFA-Tradengineer - An automated algorithmic trading platform combining MDFA-Toolkit, MDFA-DeepLearning, and Esper - a 
   library for complex event processing (CEP) and streaming analytics   

To start the most basic signal extraction process using MDFA-Toolkit, three things need to be defined. 
1) The data streaming process which determines from where and what kind of data will be streamed
2) A transformation of the data, which includes any logarithmic transform, normalization, and/or (fractional) differencing
3) A signal extraction definition which is defined by the MDFA parameterization   

Data streaming:
In the current version, time series data is providing by a streaming CSVReader, where the time series index (DateTime stamp is the first column, and
the value(s) are given in the following columns. For multivariate data, two options are available for streaming data.
1) A multiple column .csv file, with each value of the time series in a separate column
2) or in multiple referenced single column time-stamped .csv files.  In this case, the time series DateTime stamps will be checked to see if in agreement. 
If not, an error will be thrown. More sophisticated multivariate time series data streamers which account for missing values will soon be available.   

Transforming the data:
Depending on the type of time series data and the application or objectives of the real-time signal extraction process, transforming the data
in real-time might be an attractive feature. The transformation of the data can include (but not limited to) several different things
1) A Box-Cox transform, one of the more common transformations in financial and other non-stationary time series
2) (fractional)-differencing, defined by a value d in [0,1]. When d=1, standard first-order differencing is applied.  
3) For stationary series, standard mean-variance normalization or a more exotic GARCH normalization which attempts to model the underlying 
volatility is also available.



Big Data analytics in time series
We also provide an interface to Apache Spark-TS, which provides a Spark RDD for Time series objects, geared towards high dimension multivariate time series.
Large-scale time-series data shows up across a variety of domains. Distributed as the spark-ts package, a library developed by Clouderaâ€™s Data Science team 
essentially enables analysis of data sets comprising millions of time series, each with millions of measurements. The package runs atop Apache Spark.

Installation: 
The package is built using the Gradle package and dependency management tool along with the 
lombok utility which comes as a jar file in the package. To install lombok for your IDE, please refer
to the installation instructions of lombok. 

Once the package is cloned in an appropriate folder, import it using Import->Gradle->Gradle Project (here assumes Eclipse being used). All
the dependencies will be automatically downloaded, included the ND4J which handles the vector/matrix computations, and all the JUnit tests will be run.
